# Course-repository-for-PItDS
This is a repository for Practical Introduction to Data Science, a course in MSc. Data Science, Innovation and Technology at the University of Edinburgh. I will paste here my Jupyter notebooks and helpful resources to keep track of my learning process. This includes learning Python, NumPy, Pandas and R, as well as other materials from the course.
